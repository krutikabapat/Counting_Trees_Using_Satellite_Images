# Counting_Trees_Using_Satellite_Images
Count the number of trees using satellite Images with U-Net

## Important Geo-Spatial Datasets  



## Important Libraries specific to geo-spatial dataset for .tif/.tiff files
1. Rasterio (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rasterio)  
2. Tifffle (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tifffile)  
3. Pillow  (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pillow)  
4. DetecTree  


## Methodologies for Tree Count Using Aerial Images   
1. U-Net Based Technique (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)  
2. Deep Forest(https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest)  
3. Hybrid method involving Faster R-CNN, RolPool, RPN, Softmax (https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deep-learning-based-automated-palm-tree)
